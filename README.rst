Librarian App Boostrap
======================

Librarian App Boostrap (LAB) is a simple web server that provides a
Librarian-like environment for a single Librarian application.

The main advantage of using LAB is you do not have to package your application
while you are developing it. Main disadvantage is that some of the Librarian
features cannot be tested (such as localization).

Note that LAB is not a replacement for testing with Librarian. It is merely a
convenience option to get started quickly.
